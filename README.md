Mean and Standard Deviation

 

Write a program that prompts the user for 10 floating point values. The program should invoke two methods to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the numbers. You can use the formula below to calculate the mean and standard deviations.

You will need:

A scanner object to read the 10 values
An array to store the ten values
Two methods that do the following:
Accepts an array and returns the mean
Accepts an array and returns the standard deviation
Comments where necessary
 

A sample of the output is shown below:

 

Enter ten numbers: 1.9 2.5 3.7 2 1 6 3 4 5 2
The mean is 3.1100000000000003
The standard deviation is 1.5573838462127583

 

Sum of two matrices

 

Write a program that accepts two 3 x 3 matrices and invokes a method to add them together. The formula for adding two matrices is shown below:

 

Assignment 7-1.png

You will need:

 

A scanner object to read the values that fill the arrays
Three 2-dimensional arrays:
One to store the values in the first 3x3 matrix
One to store the values in the second 3x3 matrix
One to store the sum of the values from the first two matrices
A method that adds the two matrices using the formula above
Comments where necessary
 

A sample of the output is shown below:

 

Enter matrix1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Enter matrix2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
The addition of the matrices is 
 1.0 2.0 3.0      1.0 2.0 3.0      2.0 4.0 6.0
 4.0 5.0 6.0  +   4.0 5.0 6.0  =   8.0 10.0 12.0
 7.0 8.0 9.0      7.0 8.0 9.0      14.0 16.0 18.0
Tip: You may prefer to print the results out this way instead:

 

Enter matrix1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Enter matrix2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
The addition of the matrices is

 

 1.0 2.0 3.0      
 4.0 5.0 6.0     
 7.0 8.0 9.0     
      +

 1.0 2.0 3.0      
 4.0 5.0 6.0     
 7.0 8.0 9.0

      =

 2.0 4.0 6.0

 8.0 10.0 12.0

 14.0 16.0 18.0
